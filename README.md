# BjlNetFramework
 
 A framework for implementing network protocols (FTP, SMTP, POP3, ...).  
   The framework includes interfaces and core classes for both client and server side
   of a protocol.
   
Review TestNetFramwork For a quick introduction.  It uses the framework to implement a server and a client for the "Echo" protocol. The **Client** will send commands to the server and validate the server response and a **Server**  that will receive commands and echo all them back to the client.
